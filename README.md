The purpose of my app was to create a simple ordering system for a Mexican restaurant, where users can pick their food from a list of menu items, enter the number of each item they wanted, and see the full order with the total price. I wanted to keep it basic since this is my first time coding in Python. I was able to get the whole app working, including the dropdown, quantity input, and order confirmation. The only thing is I wanted to put it all in the same pop-up but in the end, I couldn’t figure that part out. I also forgot I had to use main.mainloop(), so for a while my app wasn’t doing anything. Then, I had to figure out the use of “readonly” to make sure that users couldn’t just input whatever they wanted. Funnily enough, the part I found most challenging was getting GitHub set up, but that was because I’m trying to make sure I do everything through the CLI instead of the website. In the future, I’d like to add the ability to remove items from the order or maybe display a running total as you add items. I learned a lot about how GUIs work and how all the little details (like making sure input is valid) really matter. Overall, this was a solid intro to both Python and a good refresher for coding in general, as my only other coding experience was Java.
